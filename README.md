MyLesen is a hackathon project that Programophobia created.
The core idea of it being virtualizing the license owning process in Malaysia.
As of currently, The license owning process is completely done manually and in person
and we thought it would be a cool idea to simplify and do the processes such as registering for
classes and tests online
